# Version Control

Making an open world game is a huge undertaking. I use Github and Git for version in 90% of all cases. However, with this open world game I moved over to Plastic SCM.

I did try LFS with Git, and while the solution can work for large projects, I decided to give Plastic SCM a try, the version control company Unity recently purchased.

I will continue using Github for the majority of projects, but with checking very large files for an open world game Plastic SCM seems like a more dedicated solution. In the future I would also like to try Perforce.
