# RPG Game

I wanted to make a vertical slice for an RPG game. Wtih a vertical slice I could experiment with systems, while efficiently moving forward.

# Version Control




I use Github and git for version in 90% of all cases. However, with this open world game I moved over to Plastic SCM.

I did try LFS with Git, and while the solution can work for large projects, I decided to give Plastic SCM a try, the version control company Unity recently purchased.

I will continue using Github for the majority of projects, but with checking very large files for an open world game Plastic SCM seems like a more dedicated solution. In the future I would also like to try Perforce.

Plastic SCM is built right into Unity, so the workflow is fast. However for smaller projects, I will continue to use git, because git works well for 99% of cases. The only reason I would consider using Plastic SCM is when working with extremely large file sizes, which git was just simply not built for.
